# enterprise-build-sample-js

This sample application shows how to run a dojo build on a 4.x ArcGIS API for JavaScript application to get it ready for production. The sample intends for bower to be used for dependency management to download the ArcGIS API for JavaScript, dojo, and other dependencies and grunt to run the dojo build (both of which depend on Node.js). This sample is using the 4.3 version of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. Updated bower files for newer versions of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript can be found at [https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources](https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources).

## Features
* Sample Enterprise Application - Formatted and developed to work with Automated Dojo Builds
* Sample Grunt File - Build file to be adapted to your own applications
* Build Profiles - Sample dojo build profile files to be adapted to your own applications
* Bower File - to download the Dojo, dgrid, put-selector, and xstyle source code, which has been patched to better work with the ArcGIS JavaScript API and the ArcGIS JavaScript API AMD Build.
